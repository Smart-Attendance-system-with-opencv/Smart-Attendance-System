# Smart-Attendance-System

# DESCRIPTION
Attendance management is important for every single organization.In our current situation most of
the institutions are conducting online classes by using different appications that are available.In
those applications there is no such feature to take attendance automatically.Most of the institutions
are collecting students attendance data in the form of google forms or by calling their roll numbers
during class hours.This is a time consuming task for both students and the faculty.So maintaining
these attendance records of the students is a tedious task for the institutions.
We came up with a solution to collect students attendance data in simple way by using our project.
Our project focusses on using the time efficiently by using a simple technique for taking attendance
of students.It is very easy to take the attendance using our project.It takes less than a minute to
collect the attendance of students.
It is a command line GUI(Graphical User Interface) application.Just by using the screenshot of the
total students details and the attendance list of the students,the attendance is recorded on that
particular day.All the students who are attended to the class on that day,those students attendance
data will be recorded in the respective excel sheet.In this way,we can easily collect attendance of the
students in a small amount of time and there is no extra work to be done by the students and faculty.
